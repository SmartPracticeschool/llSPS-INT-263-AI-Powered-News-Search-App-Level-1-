# Project Motivation:
Being aware of daily news is crucial thing for everyone. For that we can get this app to be used for daily purpose like getting RSS feed online without any interaction, getting top news and many more.<br>
Here in this project we have deployed this news search app that searches news based on the keywords we give, and retrieve that news with most popularity filter. <br>
Moreover, for integration part, we integrated whole service with Slack. Where we can chat with that bot to get desired news.<br>
